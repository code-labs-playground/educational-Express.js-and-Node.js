# Building a Website with Node.js and Express.js

This repository contains code and exercises for learning how to build a website using Node.js and Express.js. It's based on educational content for web development with these popular JavaScript technologies.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Set up a Node.js development environment
- Create a web server using Express.js
- Handle routing and middleware
- Serve static files and dynamic content
- Build a complete website from scratch

## Repository Structure

This repository uses branches to organize different stages of development. You can switch between branches to see the progression of the project.

### Branch Naming Convention
- Branches are named using the format `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#` (e.g., `02_03` for chapter 2, video 3)
- Some branches have beginning (`b`) and end (`e`) states showing before and after code changes
- The `final` branch contains the completed project

### Switching Branches
To switch to a specific branch:
```bash
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```

If you encounter conflicts when switching branches:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save current progress"
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd building-website-nodejs-express
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Text editor or IDE

## Getting Started

1. Start with the `main` branch to see the initial setup
2. Follow along with each chapter by switching to the corresponding branch
3. Make your own modifications and experiment with the code
4. Use the final branch as a reference for the completed project

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web application framework
- **HTML/CSS** - Frontend markup and styling
- **JavaScript** - Client and server-side scripting

## Learning Path

1. **Setup and Configuration** - Initialize the project and install dependencies
2. **Basic Express Server** - Create your first web server
3. **Routing** - Handle different URL paths
4. **Middleware** - Add functionality to request/response cycle
5. **Static Files** - Serve CSS, images, and other assets
6. **Templates** - Generate dynamic HTML content
7. **Final Integration** - Combine all concepts into a complete website
